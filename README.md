# ygo-bubble-tea

This is a command-line application that allows you to search for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards using
the [Ygoprodeck API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/).
It is written in Go and uses the [Bubble Tea Framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), along with
the [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) styling library
and [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) components library for a polished and interactive user
interface.
You can search for a card name, select a card from a list of cards, and view detailed information about it.
